# Wordle-solver

Easy to use Wordle Solver which completes all Wordles and optimizes for minimum tries.

Usage:
- Compile `wordle.c` (uses `math.h` header for entropy calculations so use `-lm` flag with `gcc`).
- After every word suggested, input the feedback from wordle, e.g. `bbygb` for 拘勇拘勇游릳游릴拘勇
- Input `ggggg` to ensure it quits correctly when the word matches.

Example usage:\
`soare`\
byybb\
`bloat`         <--- The second word might take some time to print (this is the most computationally heavy step) \
bggyg\
`aloft`\
ggggg

Result:\
Wordle 231 3/6

拘游릳游릳拘拘뜦
拘游릴游릴游릳游릴\
游릴游릴游릴游릴游릴

New optimizations significantly reduce the number of steps needed (in most cases).
